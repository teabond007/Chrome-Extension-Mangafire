<dl>
<dt>Solves the Problem</dt>
  <dd>when you are searching for new things to read, it doesn't show you immidietly if you have it saved and it also doesn't show you that in a clear way. It also only shows you Bookmarked mangas and not your history.
</dd>
</dl>


<dl>
<dt>How it works</dt>
<dd>Extension Scrapes your Bookmarks(Saved mangas) and your History(Read Mangas) for the name of the manga and its status(Reading, Completed, Dropped...).
Every time you load MangaFire page it checks if mangas shown match with scraped data and if so, colors the border.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>Extension offers multiple options:</dt>
<dd>1. Sync Mangas automaticly every user set days,
2. Custom border size when Highlighting/Marking,
3. Marking your History the same way as Saved mangas,
4. and more.</dd>
</dl>

Download the folder(less than 1Mb) go to chrome://extensions enable developer mode(top right) and Load unpacked(top left).
> IMPORTANT! you have to Sync Bookmarks with the press of a button at least once on either extensions popup or settings page.
