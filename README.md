## 🚀 Why Use This?
Finding new manga to read can be frustrating when you can't instantly see what you've already read or saved. MangaFire's default interface doesn't always make this clear at a glance. 

**Bookmark Color Marker** solves this by visually tagging manga covers with colored borders corresponding to their status (e.g., Reading, Completed, Plan to Read) directly on the browsing pages.

## ✨ Features
- **Automatic Highlighting**: Instantly spot your saved manga with custom colored borders.
- **Custom Statuses**: Create your own bookmark categories with unique names, colors, and border styles.
- **History Sync**: Optionally highlight manga that are in your reading history but not bookmarked.
- **Auto-Sync**: Automatically updates your local bookmark cache in the background.
- **Visual Customization**: Adjust border thickness and style (Solid, Dashed, Dotted, etc.) to your preference.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Seamlessly integrates with the browser with a beautiful, responsive UI.
